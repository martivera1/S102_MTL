# My Piano Rank

# Overview
In the domain of music, the notion of difficulty in piano performance is multidimensional and personalized, varying greatly 
based on individual skill levels and experience. What may be challenging to one pianist could be easier for another, highlighting 
the subjectivity in assessing difficulty. To address this variability, we present our solution: A Personalized Piano Score Rating System.

# Project Description
This project aims to develop a web-based tool that allows users to input YouTube link of a piano piece, along with their subjective difficulty ratings.
Utilizing machine learning algorithms, our system will select some piano scores that align precisely with each user's specified criteria.
By integrating technology with musical exploration, our goal is to empower users in discovering piano pieces and enriching their music education experience.

# Data Source
We have utilized the TROMPA-MER dataset for creating our specialized rankings. TROMPA-MER is an open dataset designed to support research in Music Emotion Recognition (MER).
